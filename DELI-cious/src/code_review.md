Perfect, here's the continuation of the review:

---

### ✅ Review of `HomeScreen.java`

#### ✔️ Strengths:

* Acts as a central point for user interaction, which is a natural design choice.

#### ⚠️ Suggestions:

* **Too Much in One Class**: If `HomeScreen` manages user input, displays menus, and processes orders, it's doing too much.

    * Separate into:

        * `HomeScreenUI` (display and input)
        * `OrderManager` or `OrderController` (business logic)
* **Single Responsibility Principle**: According to *Workbook 4* and *Workbook 6*, a class should either “know” or “do”, not both.
* **Code Reuse**: Look for repeated blocks of code—e.g., building menus or parsing input—and extract helper methods or classes.

### ✅ Review of `Order.java`

#### ✔️ Strengths:

* Good encapsulation of the “order” concept.

#### ⚠️ Suggestions:

* **Data + Behavior**: Make sure `Order` includes both state (items, prices) and behavior (e.g., calculate total, add/remove items).
* **Constructor Overloading**: If you're creating orders in different ways (e.g., empty vs. with items), consider overloading constructors (see *Workbook 2*, Section 2–3).
* **Use of Collections**: Prefer `ArrayList` or `HashMap` over arrays for flexibility and ease of use (see *Workbook 3*, Module 3).

### ✅ Review of `DrinkTest.java`

#### ✔️ Strengths:

* Excellent that you’re writing unit tests! This aligns with *Workbook 4* and *Workbook 6*’s emphasis on testing and quality.

#### ⚠️ Suggestions:

* **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive test names, like `testSetSizeUpdatesPrice()` instead of `testDrink1`.
* **Coverage**: Make sure you’re testing both typical and edge cases (e.g., null values, invalid input).
* **Use JUnit Assertions**: Prefer `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, etc., over manual output checks.

---

### Overall Design Thoughts:

* You're on the right track! The app models a food ordering system, but there's **room to improve separation of concerns**:

    * UI vs. logic
    * Shared superclass for menu items
    * Enum use for size and item categories

Would you like a visual or text-based refactoring plan next? Or do you want to dive deeper into one of the classes or concepts (like inheritance or interface design)?
